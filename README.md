# Resume
This is a library management system built in C++, leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage books, subscribers, and borrow/return operations. It features efficient file handling and modular code design, making it both scalable and maintainable.

# Project Description
Sophia-Biblio: A Library Management System

Sophia-Biblio is a library management system developed in C++, leveraging the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability. This project demonstrates how OOP concepts such as classes, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism can be applied to create a robust and user-friendly software solution for managing library operations.

# Key Features
Borrow and Return System: Allows tracking of books borrowed by subscribers with automated due date calculations.
Subscriber Management: Includes features for adding, modifying, and listing subscribers.
Book Management: Facilitates the addition, search, update, and deletion of books.
Violation Handling: Identifies subscribers who have overdue returns and lists them with detailed information.
Data Persistence: All data is stored in binary files, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval.

# Technical Highlights
Written entirely in C++, showcasing the language's capabilities for system-level programming and file handling.
Comprehensive use of OOP concepts, making the code modular and easy to extend.
Efficient file operations for data storage using binary files (.dat).

This project is ideal for those looking to understand how to implement OOP principles in a real-world application while exploring advanced C++ features like file I/O, pointers, and lambda functions.
